### JShell (CSE 213) ###

* A basic shell/terminal-like application written in Java using Swing. for my Object Oriented Programming class. It's not technically a shell (it doesn't search for and run executables, instead the functionality of each needed command was implemented natively in Java, within the myShell.java class)
* Also uses sockets to provide basic messaging between two shells
* Developers: Kevin Hardy, David Huff

### How do I get set up? ###

Import the repo into Eclipse and compile/run it from there. I haven't tested running the code directly through javac, but running "javac ShellWindow.java" then "java ShellWindow" should work.

### Who do I talk to? ###
